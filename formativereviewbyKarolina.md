"Interesting content" = Very interesting content! Covers many aspects of the topic :)
"Consistency and quality of visual presentation" = The visual presentation is very nicely done! However, the pages' themes do not really match up.
"Quality of written presentation" = The writing is thorough and engaging.
"Validity of HTML" = Many pages have dead links and one page does not feature any links back to the other pages. 
An image does not display on one of the pages. However, the hyperlinks work correctly.
"Author info not written by author" = n/a
"Balanced contributions from members" = All members did a page each; very good distribution of work!
"Not completed at the last minute" = Does not look like it. My only gripe is the dead links, but from my own experience I know how
finicky the process is of actually getting everything to work together without breaking something else in the process. 

Great website :D
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review it!
